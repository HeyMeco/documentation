# Welcome to the Armbian Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of Armbian Linux, a highly optimized base operating system specialized for single board computers (*SBCs*) and its extensive build framework.

## How is the documentation structured?

The table of contents in the sidebar and the links at the top of the page should let you easily access the documentation for your topic of interest.

If you are **new to Armbian**, the [_Introduction_](index.md) and the [_Getting Started_](User-Guide_Getting-Started.md) sections provide everything you need to know about the project, where to find the resources for your board, and a tutorial for everything you need to get Armbian running.

It then continues on to [_Configuration_](User-Guide_Configuration.md) tasks and tools to customize your installation, e.g. change the network address, start or stop services like SSH, or install one of the many prepared software stacks. This section and the links contained in it are useful to **all user levels**.

**Advanced users** will find more complex topics in the [_Advanced_](User-Guide_Advanced-Features.md) section, including how to customize your initial installation.

If you have read through the documentation and still **need help**, check out our [_Troubleshooting_](User-Guide_Troubleshooting.md) advice.
